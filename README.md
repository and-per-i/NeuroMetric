## 📋 Overview
**NeuroMetric** is an Artificial Intelligence framework developed to support the objective diagnosis of *Movement Disorders* starting from simple RGB videos, without the use of wearable sensors.

The system uses a hybrid pipeline combining geometric feature extraction via **MediaPipe** with deep temporal analysis via recurrent neural networks (**LSTM**). The current version (V3.2) addresses the critical issues of previous models by introducing a **Hybrid Vector (Local + Global)** architecture capable of distinguishing micro-movements (tremors) from macro-movements (complex tics/neck jerks).

## 🚀 Key Features (V3.2)

* **🎥 "In the Wild" Markerless Analysis:** Works on standard videos with unconstrained subjects, thanks to a robust **Kinematic Normalization** pipeline (Nose Anchoring + Scale Invariance).
* **🧠 Hybrid Architecture & "The Boost":** Combines 248 local features (eyes/mouth) with global head velocity vectors amplified (Feature Scaling x100) to detect complex tics and Head Jerks otherwise invisible.
* **⚡ Physiological Data Augmentation:** Training on synthetic datasets generated by simulating the physical laws of symptoms (Harmonic oscillators for tremor, Impulse functions for Tics, Random Walk for Dyskinesia).
* **📊 Interactive Clinical Reporting:** Automatically generates an HTML dashboard with statistics and event timelines of detected anomalies in a loop for medical analysis.
* **🛡️ Temporal Stabilization:** Post-processing algorithms (*Patience* & *Visual Hold*) to eliminate flickering and provide stable and readable detections.

## 🩺 Supported Pathologies
The model classifies 6 distinct states based on movement kinematics:
1.  **🟢 NORMAL:** Physiological movement.
2.  **🟠 TIC (Tourette Syndrome):** Ballistic, rapid, and jerky movements (including neck jerks).
3.  **🔴 TREMOR (Parkinson/Essential):** Rhythmic oscillations.
4.  **🟣 HYPOMIMIA (Depression/Parkinson):** Pathological reduction of expressivity and motor gain.
5.  **⚫ PARESIS (Bell's Palsy):** Static and dynamic asymmetry (Droop).
6.  **🔵 DYSKINESIA (Tardive/Chorea):** Slow, fluid, and chaotic involuntary movements.
